This module provides effects for the coroutine, comes
from [@Control.Monad.Freer.Coroutine@](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple-1.2.1.2/docs/Control-Monad-Freer-Coroutine.html)
in the @freer-simple@ package (The continuation part @(b -> c)@ has been removed. If necessary, please manually compose the t`Data.Functor.Coyoneda.Coyoneda`) .
-}
module Data.Effect.Coroutine where

import Control.Monad ((>=>))

{- |
An effect for coroutines.
Realizes an operation that transfers control to the caller of the computation with coroutines along with a value of type @a@,
and receives a value of type @b@ from the caller.
-}
data Yield a b :: Effect where
    -- | Transfers control to the caller of the computation with coroutines along with a value of type @a@, and receives a value of type @b@ from the caller.
    Yield :: a -> Yield a b f b

makeEffectF ''Yield

-- | A version of `yield` where the value returned from the caller of the computation with coroutines is unit.
yield_ :: (Yield a () :> es, Free c ff) => a -> Eff ff es ()
yield_ = yield
{-# INLINE yield_ #-}

{- |
The execution result when handling a computation that includes the t`Yield` effect. A computation that may include suspension.
If the computation does not include `yield`, the completed result of the computation is obtained as `Done`.
If the computation includes `yield`, execution is suspended at that point, and the value of type @a@ thrown by `yield` and the continuation of the computation from the point of `yield` are obtained as `Continue`.
By re-executing this continuation, you can resume the computation.
